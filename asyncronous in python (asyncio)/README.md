# Asynchronous Programming with asyncio

This repository demonstrates the usage of `asyncio`, a Python library for writing asynchronous code using coroutines, event loops, and tasks.

## What is asyncio?

`asyncio` is a built-in Python library that enables the development of concurrent and asynchronous applications. It provides a framework for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.

With `asyncio`, you can write code that efficiently handles concurrent operations without the need for multiple threads or callbacks. It leverages the `async` and `await` syntax introduced in Python 3.5 to define coroutines, which are special functions that can be paused and resumed. This allows you to write non-blocking, cooperative multitasking code that can handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.

## Features of asyncio

- **Coroutines**: `asyncio` allows you to write asynchronous code using coroutines. Coroutines are functions defined with the `async` keyword and can be suspended using the `await` keyword.

- **Event Loop**: `asyncio` provides an event loop, which is a central execution component that schedules and runs coroutines, handles I/O operations, and manages callbacks.

- **Tasks**: Tasks are higher-level abstractions over coroutines. They represent the execution of a coroutine in an event loop. Tasks can be used to track the progress and retrieve results from coroutines.

- **Concurrency**: `asyncio` enables efficient concurrent programming. It supports running multiple coroutines concurrently within a single thread, allowing you to achieve concurrency without the need for multiple threads or processes.

- **Network Operations**: `asyncio` includes components for network programming, such as clients and servers. It provides support for TCP, UDP, SSL, and other protocols.

- **Integration**: `asyncio` can be integrated with other libraries and frameworks. It provides compatibility with existing codebases and allows you to combine asynchronous code with synchronous code as needed.

## Getting Started

To run the examples in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barzansaeedpour/advanced_python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd "asyncronous in python (asyncio)"
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Unix/macOS**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the desired example script:

   ```bash
   python example.py
   ```

## Examples

This repository includes several examples that demonstrate various aspects of `asyncio`:

1. `example1.py`: Basic example showcasing the usage of `async` and `await` to define coroutines.

2. `example2.py`: Demonstrates the event loop and the execution of multiple coroutines concurrently.

3. `example3.py`: Illustrates the usage of tasks to track the execution of coroutines.

4. `example4.py`: Shows how to perform asynchronous network operations with `asyncio`.

Feel free to explore and modify the examples to further understand the capabilities of `asyncio`.
