## Design Patterns in Python

This GitHub repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in Python. Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a reusable template to solve specific issues and can help developers avoid common pitfalls and improve the maintainability of their code.

The patterns included in this repository are:

- [**Singleton Pattern**](./01_singleton.py): Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance.

- [**Factory Pattern**](./02_factory.py): Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 

- [**Observer Pattern**](./14_observer.py): Allows objects to be notified when a change occurs in another object. 

- [**Decorator Pattern**](./07_decorator.py): Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 

- [**Strategy Pattern**](./17_strategy.py): Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime. 

- [**Command Pattern**](./02_factory.py): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 

- [**Facade Pattern**](./08_facade.py): Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.

- [**Adapter Pattern**](./06_adapter.py): Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. 

- [**Template Method Pattern**](./16_template%20method.py): Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 

Each design pattern is implemented in a separate Python file, which includes a brief description of the pattern, its purpose, and an example of how it can be used in practice.

Feel free to use and modify these code examples for your own projects or to further your understanding of software design patterns. Contributions and feedback are always welcome.
